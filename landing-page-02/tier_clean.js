/**
 * Device tier for the hero scene — decided once at construction, read by
 * everything (DPR, frame budget, pointer, antialias, mask cost) so values can
 * never drift apart. Feature-local port of the canonical device module from
 * the optimize-3d-scene skill (§2).
 *
 * Read at construction, and re-read when the container's **width** changes or
 * the pointer class flips — a device does not change tier mid-session, but a
 * window dragged across a breakpoint and a device emulator switched off both
 * do, and the scene has to follow (`HeroScene.retune`). What is baked into
 * shader source or the GL context (`trailSamples`, `antialias`) stays as
 * built; everything else is live.

/**
 * The cap for touch tiers, as the shared ticker measures it.

 * 1000/60 lets a 60Hz screen through every tick (16.67 is not <= 16.67 minus
 * float noise… until it is), and on a 120Hz screen the first tick past it
 * lands at 25ms — 40fps, not 60. Two milliseconds under puts 60Hz on every
 * tick and 120Hz on every second one, which is what "60" is meant to say.
